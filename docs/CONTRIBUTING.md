### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the project, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/jamesbrond/todoist-template/issues).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/jamesbrond/todoist-template/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. You are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

2. Fork the repository.

- Using GitHub Desktop:

  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.

  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:

  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install or update to **Python 3.10.4**.

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](#self-review) to speed up the review process.

### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems. Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations we thanks you.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible.
